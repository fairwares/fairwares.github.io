			<h1><abbr title="International Workshop on Equitable Data and Technology">Fairware'22</abbr><br></h1>
			<p>
				The International Workshop on Equitable Data & Technology brings together academic researchers, industry researchers, and practitioners interested in exploring ways to build <b>fairer, more equitable</b>, data-driven software.
				
				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				Co-located with ICSE’22, the FairWare’22 meeting will include
				keynotes on software fairness form different perspectives. FairWare’22
				will also host panel sessions to invite researchers and
				the audience to engage in discussion.
				
				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				Since many issues associated with fairness are often sociological in
				nature, we welcome <b>commentaries from outside of computer
				science</b> that can shed light on the complex issue of fairness.

				<h2>About FairWare</h2>
				There are too many recent examples where software has been implicated in the perpetuation of social injustice. For example, facial recognition software used by police historically, still today, mimic the inequities in the criminal justice system.
				Healthcare software contributes to disparities in access and treat ment. Online search engines perpetuate societal stereotypes. E-commerce uses (and contributes to) differences in treatment and expectations of economic classes.

			</div>
			<div class="span9">
				<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
				Society now demands that its software be fairer and more equitable. Governments, companies and professional societies such as the European Union, Microsoft, and the IEEE have white papers discussing requirements for fair and ethical software. While these documents differ in the details, they all agree that ethical software should must be "FAT"; i.e. fair, accountable and transparent and include:
				
				<ul>
					<li> Integration with <b>human agency</b>
					<li> <b>Accountability</b> where conclusions are challenged
					<li> <b>Transparency</b> of how conclusions are made
					<li> Oversight on what must change to <b>fix bad conclusions</b>
					<li> <b>Inclusiveness</b> such that no specific segment of society is especially and unnecessarily privileged or discriminated
				</ul>

				<h2>Keynote:  Centering the Margins: An inquiry into equity, justice, & society</h2>
					<p> Participatory design (PD) is idealized as a democratic approach to creativity and design thinking, yet in many instances, 
					this method translates to a privileged activity. Although this method has become what feels like an ethical answer to 
					individuals at the margins, the sheer use of PD inherently creates an imbalance in power and equality between 
					trained designer/academic researcher and those at the focus of the design. As many marginalized communities have historically 
					been exploited by research in the ivory tower, PD engagements can be greatly steeped in these power dynamics and any cultural 
					differences between researcher and community/ individual, despite careful attention and focus that might be placed on making 
					PD inclusive. In this talk, I focus the attention of the HCI and design community on more equitable and ethical PD 
					engagements examining how we conduct design research with certain communities and how deficit approaches are embedded in 
					our research practices, such as houseless emerging adults attempting to break the cycle of poverty. By reflecting on these 
					tensions as a call to action, I hope to deconstruct the privileges of our actions and re-center the focus of design on 
					individuals who are historically underserved. </p>
				<p>Speaker:  <b>Dr. Angela D.R. Smith</b> <a href=" https://angeladrsmith.com/"> https://angeladrsmith.com/</a><br>
					 Dr. Angela D.R. Smith is an Assistant Professor at the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin.
					She received her doctoral degree from Northwestern University in Technology & Social Behavior, a joint degree in
					Communications and Computer Science. Her research is in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported 
					Cooperative Work, and Information Sciences. Her current research explores how critical and intersectional theoretical 
					lenses can inform an assets-based participatory design of technologies to support historically marginalized groups,
					such as individuals of color and individuals experiencing homelessness, in pursuing sustainable, emancipatory 
					transformations and socially responsible technology experiences. Through qualitative, participatory design methods,
					she seeks to co-construct knowledge, conscientization, and design interventions with these populations.
